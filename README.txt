Drag and Drop any anb onto the Anm-Generator.exe.
Make sure the anb name is for Sora named "p_ex100.anb". For Donald "p_ex020.anb" and so on. 

If you wanna make your own list, just add in the folder "lists" a new .yml with the paths and names of the cutscene animations.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind, this tool wworks with ANY file you throw at it aslong the yml exists in the lists folder.
